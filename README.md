# MoodyFinancialTablesExtraction

Worked as software developer in research project for Professor Brian Wolfe of Finance Department at University at Buffalo.
This project was related to extracting the Moody's General Obligation and Sales Tables data from more than 20 books spanning from year 1980 to 1994.
Features:
1. Firstly, we needed to scan the relevant tables from all the books containing Moody's tables.
2. We used Rest API OCR Web Service to convert scanned documents to txt files.
3. Then we write different programs to extract data from txt files and create output as Excel files with relevant data into corresponding columns.

Technologies Used: Java, OCR Web Service Rest API
